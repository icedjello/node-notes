# Reminder

A CLI application inspired by [intro-node-v3]https://github.com/Hendrixer/intro-node-v3
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://github.com/Hendrixer/intro-node-v3).

## What's the point?

The point here is provide a cli to help you in the terminal.
We'd all love to be terminal wizards who know all the commands all the time but getting there can be a little difficult. You probably don't have to Google the commands you use everyday, it's the infrequent ones that cause problems. And that's hopefully where Reminder can help out!

Instead of writing down complicated or hard to remember commands (paper, ew!) or asking Google (also ew), when you find/use a command that might come in handy, why not save it to Reminder, with tags for organisation, and an explaination so you remember what it does!

This is a practice project.

### TODO:

-   make the readme look pretty (ongoing)
-   add an optional `command` for notes
-   rename stuff to make it make sense
-   make the find functionality case-insensitive
-   make a proper server
-   more tests
-   add sqlite database
